For this assignment you will be creating a page that utilizies tables and an HTML input form.

The first requirement is that you create a table with at least 5 employees that have the following information:

The information for the table will be made up by you (use professional standards).
You will be graded on how you use table, tr, and td tags for this portion of the assignment.

After the table, a form to add a new employee should be present.
The form should include all of the information for an employee listed above.
It should be delivered to www.radford.edu/newEmployee when submitted using the POST method.
